Once upon a time I decided to apply for a job. It was advertised on a very popular classified site. I clicked on the button to apply. The link took me to another job listing site. Here I needed to log into my existing account which I had no recollection of, I had to reset my password to get access. Then another link was revealed; it brought me to my application (the future of forms is here they say). The nice software welcomed me and asked my name and then more questions. I had to answer or I would need to leave, I made a mistake but I couldn't go back. I didn't have all the right answers but I continued undeterred. If I were to write down all these steps it would probably take up two paragraphs--depending on the lenght of a paragraph; they can sometimes be just one sentence--especially if I rambled on a bit.. By the time I write this I aready know what's coming, I've had to restart 3 times.
