**What to keep in mind when producing content for a luxury brand?**

* Take into account your target market—since luxury brands are more expensive, the typical audience will be older. Make sure to market the brand in a way that is more appealing and accessible to older people.


* Spread the content throughout the different media channels.


* Use the content to engage with your potential customers and to give a unique voice to the brand. Customers should associate themselves with the content.


* Content for luxury brands needs professional photography and high production values.


* Emphasize the brand's history, materials, tradition, cultural associations—highlight the maker, and its artisanal qualities.


* Use the content to make it easier to discover and purchase the product.


* Show the content in online advertising and video.


* Provide insider knowledge and customer stories.


* When presenting the content digitally, make sure it is easy to access and read. This is especially important for older customers. Very few websites do it well.


* Text should be easy to read—nobody will leave a website because the text is too big, but people will leave if it hurts their eyes.


* Make a site intuitive and easy to navigate. Don't assume that people will simply understand how it works.


* Online accessibility is a big issue in web design, sites should be accessible to everyone. Many people can not use a mouse, so everything on a website should be accessible using a keyboard and should make sense to screen readers.


* By configuring a website correctly you can increase your market while creating a lot of good will.
